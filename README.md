# Discord Learn
Award-Winning Submission for RU Hacks 2021

## About
Discord Learn helps instructors begin and manage a classroom on their own Discord server while easily able to teach as effectively and quickly as they would in person. Starting the server is as easy as just entering in two commands and the bot will do it all for you! All the channels, the commands and even permissions are automatically set up by Discord Learn. When you want to schedule an event, let the bot know and it will remind the students a little ahead of time so no one’s late and even connect it to your own google account to access your own google calendar. If a student does arrive late, take attendance and the bot will let you know who that is. Don’t worry about the noise in the classroom, all students are automatically muted with the option to request a chance to speak up when they have a question. And keep your class engaged by setting up breakout rooms and polls for class participation. All of these tools and more are readily available to help create the learning environment teachers should expect.
